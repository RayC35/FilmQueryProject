## Difficulties and Lessons Learned
This project was the first one to require use of JDBC and SQL. As such, it was particularly challenging implementing the proper syntax, as well as understanding several new methods and objects. Moreover, it was difficult understanding just how these different technologies and languages interacted with eachother, where altering code in one area might affect something else. But in the end, I began to feel better about all these things, and I find myself enjoying SQL. And Java continues to become clearer and clearer to me, this project really helped with my understanding of exceptions and reading the stack trace.
